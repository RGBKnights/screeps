# screeps-starter

> Hive AI [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)-based [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) AI codes.


## Getting Started

### Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v4.0.0+)
* Gulp 4.0+ - `sudo npm install -g gulpjs/gulp.git#4.0`

### Installing npm modules

Then run the following the command to install the required npm packages and TypeScript type definitions.

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Running the compiler

```bash
# To compile your TypeScript files on the fly
$ npm start

# To deploy the code to Screeps
$ npm run deploy
```

You can also use `deploy-prod` instead of `deploy` for a bundled version of the project, which has better performance but is harder to debug.

`deploy-local` will copy files into a local folder to be picked up by steam client and used with the official or a private server.
